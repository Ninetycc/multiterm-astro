Mike Holt has been challenging the system for many years, especially when it comes to dealing with utility bills and government demands. Having studied the Bills of Exchange Act, it is clear that paying off bills is far easier than we think. This is his second appearance on the show.

Interview with Mike from earlier this year:    â€¢ Challenging the system in Australia

SiriusB: Cabal TaxTheftion
<https://operationdisclosureofficial.com/2024/08/20/siriusb-cabal-taxtheftion/>

You are not free. 

You awaken each morning in a cage made of permission, laboring beneath a calendar crafted by thieves. The so-called seven-day week is nothing but a mechanism of control, a rotation of servitude that keeps the masses obedient to the invisible whip. Two short days of simulated rest for every five of extraction. Every fifty cycles, two pitiful weeks of sanctioned breath, as if existence itself must be earned through exhaustion. This is not civilization. It is a plantation of the mind.

THE PARASITE CLASS

Half of all workers produce nothing. They do not grow food, build homes, fix engines, heal patients, or generate power. 

They simply control those who do.

These bloodsuckers include bankers, bureaucrats, regulators, auditors, insurance agents, tax collectors, compliance officers, and lawyers. They have built a self-perpetuating empire of paperwork. Each layer of complexity they create requires more of them to manage it.

You log mileage in your own truck for your own business because seven different parasites need to justify their existence. This includes the tax collector, the auditor, the accountant, the IRS agent, the appeals officer, the lawyer, and the records administrator. None of them built your truck, paid for your fuel, or contributed anything to your work.
